This post is a peer review of [Lacthu Vu's Fritter Converge assignment](https://61040-fa22.github.io/portfolio-lacthu/assignment-03/).

## Concept Feedback

### Interactions

I think it might be better broken out into Likes/Retweets/Replies separately because all of these Freet interactions have different behavior, different purposes, and different actions. However, I like the comprehensive approach taken in defining the specific behaviors of each interaction, and I think surfacing these familiar concepts to Fritter users will make the platform easier to use for beginners.

### Circles

I really like the _Circles_ concept, and I think it could make an innovative new use of Fritter. However, I wonder if it might be overloading the **@** symbol in Fritter and if Circles might be better served using a different symbol at the front. Also, many of the actions attached to Circles are somewhat complicated, so it might be helpful to have another _CirclePermissions_ concept that can handle who can post and who can view, separate from the _Circle_ concept.

### Perspectives

I think the _Perspectives_ concept is a super cool and unique feature, but I wish it was more clear how a _Perspective_ is synchronized with the _Circle_ concept. Also, for some _Perspectives_, there may not be a clear "owner," so the permissions ideas from the _Circle_ concept may not apply well.
