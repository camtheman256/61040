This post is a peer review of [Sarah Chieng's Fritter Converge assignment](https://61040-fa22.github.io/portfolio-SarahXC/assignments/2022/09/28/A3-Fritter-Converge.html).

## Concept Feedback

### CredibilityScore

I like how the _CredibilityScore_ concept is synchronized with all the other concepts on Fritter. It seems natural that interacting with posts, getting a following, and engaging with the platform would provide higher quality posts, though it might be useful if users could see a breakdown of their _CredibilityScore_.

### AdjustFeed

It seems like the _AdjustFeed_ concept is doing a lot, and I wonder if it could be broken apart into a few sub-concepts. In order for the _AdjustFeed_ concept to work, it could be useful to introduce a _TopicTag_ concept, which could be used in views other than the Feed, like for Search.

### Following

I'm not sure if _Following_ needs to be in its own concept. If someone has a _FritterAccount_, they necessarily also have a _Following_ list. The concepts seem closely related, so I wonder if it could be included as part of the state of the _FritterAccount_ concept.
