Welcome to the first post for my final project! My group consists of [Piero Fabrizzio Orderique](https://61040-fa22.github.io/portfolio-pforderique/), Jason Yang, and Derek Schaadt.

Our topic area is **communities**, and our final project ideas center around creating tools for connecting the MIT community and communities of students around the country.
