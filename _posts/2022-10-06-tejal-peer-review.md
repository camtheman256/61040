This post is a peer review of [Tejal Reddy's Fritter Converge assignment](https://61040-fa22.github.io/portfolio-tejalreddy/jekyll/update/2022/10/02/fritter-converge.html).

## Concept Feedback

### Freet Groupings

I wonder what it would look like if Freet groupings weren't as tied to the user concept. Right now, the Freet groupings behave like tags on blog posts, which easily allow users to find Freets with similar content. However, it might be interesting if these groupings could be shared across the platform, so that users could look for tweets of a certain topic across the entire platform. Then again, this is essentially what a _hashtag_ is, so that could be a potential familiar concept to merge with.

### Insights

The insights concept is really interesting, and I think some other platforms (like Instagram and Facebook) already implement similar features. I wish it could include some more controls, so users can take steps to limit or manage the amount of time they spend on Fritter. Users might visit the insights page expecting to be able to act on their usage of the app, and this seems like a potential way to expand this concept.

### Feed Filtering

I wish the feed filter could be more transparent around what types of Freets it's including and what concepts these filters interact with. What gets put in "Promoted" vs. "Recommended" vs. "Followed" content isn't clear, and directly tying these to other concepts could help make this feature even more powerful.
